# Coursera Regression Models: Course Project
<h1> Instructions </h1>
You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested 
in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in 
the following two questions: <br>
<ul>
<li> “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG” </li>
<li> "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions" </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2> Review criteria </h2>
Peer Grading <br>
The criteria that your classmates will use to evaluate and grade your work are shown below.
Each criteria is binary: (1 point = criteria met acceptably; 0 points = criteria not met acceptably) <br>

<h2> Criteria </h2>
<ul>
<li> Did the student interpret the coefficients correctly? </li>
<li> Did the student do some exploratory data analyses? </li>
<li> Did the student fit multiple models and detail their strategy for model selection? </li> 
<li> Did the student answer the questions of interest or detail why the question(s) is (are) not answerable? </li>
<li> Did the student do a residual plot and some diagnostics? </li>
<li> Did the student quantify the uncertainty in their conclusions and/or perform an inference correctly? </li>
<li> Was the report brief (about 2 pages long) for the main body of the report and no longer than 5 with supporting appendix of figures? </li>
<li> Did the report include an executive summary? </li>
<li> Was the report done in Rmd (knitr)? </li>
